# BRAND IDENTITY SOURCE OF TRUTH: TECH-PRECISION

This document serves as the definitive reference for all brand assets, UI/UX designs, and communication strategies. **Crucial Directive:** All user-facing interfaces, copy, and design elements must be executed in **Hebrew**, utilizing Right-to-Left (RTL) layout logic while maintaining a global "High-Tech" aesthetic.

## 1. BRAND VISION & PERSONALITY
The brand persona is **"The Digital Architect" (האדריכל הדיגיטלי).** We don't just build websites; we engineer high-speed digital infrastructure that bridges the gap between rugged reliability and elite technology.

* **The Persona:** Authoritative, efficient, and uncompromising.
* **The Linguistic Mandate:** All communication is in **Hebrew**. The tone must be "High-Tech Corporate"—direct, rhythmic, and modern.
* **The Bridge:** We speak "Business" to lawyers and "Durability" to plumbers, but always through the lens of cutting-edge technology.

## 2. VISUAL LANGUAGE
The aesthetic is **"Cyber-Sophistication,"** specifically optimized for RTL (Right-to-Left) environments.

* **General Style:** Minimalist with sharp edges ($0px-4px$ border radius) to convey mechanical precision.
* **Theme:** **Strict Dark Mode.** Depth is created through layering and subtle glow effects rather than light-colored backgrounds.
* **RTL Architecture:** All layouts must be mirrored. Logos reside on the **top right**, and navigation flows from right to left.
* **Textures:** Use background-blur (Glassmorphism) and subtle digital noise to add a premium, tactile feel to the dark interface.

## 3. COLOR PALETTE
A high-performance palette designed for high-contrast legibility and an "Elite Command Center" feel.

| Category | Role | HEX Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Base** | Main Backgrounds | `#000000` | Pure Black |
| **Surface** | Card Layers / UI Containers | `#1A1A1A` | Obsidian Gray |
| **Accent 1** | Primary CTAs / Key Icons | `#007BFF` | Electric Blue |
| **Accent 2** | Highlights / Hover States | `#00F2FF` | Cyber Cyan |
| **Typography** | Primary Hebrew Text | `#FFFFFF` | Pure White |
| **Subtext** | Secondary Details | `#A0A0A0` | Steel Gray |

## 4. TYPOGRAPHY (HEBREW-CENTRIC)
Typography must reflect engineering precision. Only modern, geometric Hebrew sans-serifs are permitted.

### **Headlines: Heavy & Structural**
* **Font:** *Heebo* (Bold/Black) or *Ploni* (if licensed).
* **Alignment:** Right-aligned.
* **Rule:** Use large, impactful sizes for "Power Statements" in Hebrew.

### **Body Text: Clean & Functional**
* **Font:** *Assistant* or *Inter* (Hebrew Subset).
* **Style:** Regular weight, line-height set to $1.6$ for readability.
* **Alignment:** Strictly **Right-to-Left (RTL)**.

## 5. UI/UX GUIDELINES FOR AGENTS
All generated designs must adhere to these technical specifications:

* **RTL Grid Logic:** The 12-column grid must be calculated from right to left. All "Next" arrows ($\leftarrow$) and progress bars must reflect the Hebrew reading direction.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * **Buttons:** Sharp corners. Hovering triggers a `#00F2FF` (Cyan) outer glow effect.
    * **Micro-interactions:** Snappy transitions ($200ms$). Movement should feel mechanical, not organic.
* **Whitespace:** Prioritize "Industrial Space." Don't crowd the Hebrew characters; let the typography breathe against the black background.

## 6. TONE OF VOICE (HEBREW)
The brand avoids slang and flowery language. We speak in "Results."

* **Direct & Active:**
    * *Avoid:* "האתר שלכם ייבנה על ידי המומחים שלנו" (Your site will be built by our experts).
    * *Use:* "אנחנו בונים תשתיות דיגיטליות בביצועי קצה" (We build edge-performance digital infrastructure).
* **Audience Adaptation:**
    * **For Professionals:** Focus on **דיוק** (Precision) and **יוקרה** (Prestige).
    * **For Blue Collar:** Focus on **ביצועים** (Performance) and **כלים שעובדים** (Tools that work).
* **Strict Requirement:** No "Lorem Ipsum." All placeholder text must be contextually relevant Hebrew copy.

> ### **AGENT CORE INSTRUCTION**
> **EVERYTHING MUST BE PRESENTED IN HEBREW.**
> Whether generating a wireframe, a code snippet for a UI component, or a marketing pitch, the language of execution is Hebrew, and the layout is RTL.
